# The Magic System

Main component is a wand that is configured differently to cast different spells.
These spells should be customizable by the player.

Each staff is created by combining a type of wood and a gem. The wood will determine the power of the staff, the gem will determine the spell, Rings can be used to modify the
spell.
Each staff has 1+ slots and 0+ ring slots. The slots types are determined by the wood type.

Each staff can be "forged" with a different spell. The wood used will determine how powerful the spell is.
The spells are not "learned" by the player, but are "forged" into the staff. The player can only use the staff to cast spells.

The power of a staff is specific to each spell. Some attributes can be increased by rings for all staffs, such as casting speed

## Staff

---

Staff determines how powerful a spell can be combined into.

### Wood types

All staff are made from wood, but can be made from different kind of wood.

| Wood type   | Gem slots | Ring slots | drying rate | Cast delay at 100% | Special modifier            | Description                                           |

| Aerowode    | 1         | 2          | 100%        | 250 ms             | N/A                         | The wood seems to no be affected by gravity           |

| Trekant     | 3         | 2          | 100%        | 100 ms             | N/A                         | The wood is twisted to fit three gems                 |

### Wood rating

The time from cut to use will determine the power of the wood. The longer the wood is left to dry, the more powerful it will be.
When crafting to a staff the drying will stop.

The drying rate is also affected by the wood type. Some wood types will dry faster than others.

| Wood rating | Absolute power | Relative power increase | Drying duration (real time) | Drying duration total | Description                                                                                         |
|-------------|----------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

## Gems

---

Each gem will produce a different spell. The power of the spell is determined by the quality of the gem (flaw rating). Gems have names after precious stones

### Types of gems

| Gem type   | Power meaning                                     | Effect when power at 100% | cast delay at 100% power | Description                                                                                                                                           |

### Flaw ratings - more flawed decrease the power of the gem

Note that the flaw rating will only affect the power of the gem, not the whole staff

| Flaw rating | Absolute power | Relative Power decrease (this - above) | Description                                               |

## Rings

---

Rings can be used to modify the spell-entity and/or the holder of the staff.
Each ring will have a different effect on the spell.
Rings are named after elements of the periodic table, and should somewhat relate to what they are used for in the real world.

### Special rings

Some rings will have a special effect on the spell, these will not have a flaw rating.

| Special Ring type | Effect                                                                        | Name Reason                               |
