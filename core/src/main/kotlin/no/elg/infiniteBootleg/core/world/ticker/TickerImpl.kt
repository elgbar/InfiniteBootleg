/**
 * A helper class that calls a [Ticking]'s [Ticking.tick] and [Ticking.tickRare] method periodically. By default it will call it every [msDelayBetweenTicks].
 *
 *
 * The ticker will not update the if [Graphics.getFrameId] is the same as it was last
 * tick (as can be caused by fps lag), and will warn when too many ticks have been skipped.
 *
 * @param ticking The ticker to tick
 * @param name Name of the ticker thread
 * @param start If the thread should start at once
 * @param tps Ticks per seconds, must be a strictly positive number
 * @param nagDelay Minimum seconds between each nag message, If less than or equal to zero there will be no delay (note that this will be a lot of spam!)
